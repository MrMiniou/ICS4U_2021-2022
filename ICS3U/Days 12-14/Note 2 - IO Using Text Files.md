## Note – IO Using Text Files

### I/O

**Input/output**, commonly referred to as **I/O** or **IO** in computer science refers to the interactions between a program and an external source (e.g. a file, a device, a graphic user interface, etc.). It is unrelated to the  top-level domain name *.io*.


### Reading Text Files

In Python, you can open a plaintext file using `open()` and read its contents using `read()` or `readlines()`.  It's important that we also close the file using `close()` to prevent strange behaviours from happening. For example, if you forget to close the file, the program may appear like it's skipping over some parts.

Plaintext file extensions include *.txt*, *.csv*, *.tsv,* as well as files that are used for programming (*.py*, *.java*, *.c*, etc.).

We can open, read, and close a file like this:

```python
file = open("document.txt", "r")  # Replace "document.txt" with the actual name of the file
file_contents = file.read()
file.close()
```

The first parameter in the `open()` function is the file name as a string. The second parameter is the **mode** we want the file to open in.

The `r`  indicates that the file will be opened in **read mode**. The other modes are:

* `w` is for **write mode** with the cursor at the top of the file. Any data below below the cursor may get overwritten.
* `r+` or `w+` is for *both* read mode and write mode. The difference between them is that `w+` will create the file if it doesn't exist already whereas `r+` will raise an exception if the file does not exist.
* `a` is for **append mode**, which is like write mode but the the cursor starts at the end of the file. Anything above the cursor is not disturbed and cannot be overwritten.
* `a+` is for *both* read mode and append mode.

The **cursor** is the location where the data gets written.


Suppose we have a file called `document.txt` and it contains the following:

```
testing testing
1 2 3
```

We can use `readl()` to store the entire contents of the file in a string. The following program will print `testing testing` `1 2 3` on two lines.

```python
file = open("document.txt", "r")
file_contents = file.read()
print(file_contents)
file.close()
```

We can also use `readlines()` to store the contents of the file in a list, with each item being one line in the file. Then the following program will print `["testing testing\n", "1 2 3"]`.

```python
file = open("document.txt", "r")
file_contents = file.readlines()
print(file_contents)
file.close()
```

If we want to get rid of the newline characters that appear at the end of a line, we can use `rstrip()` (which stands for *right strip*, as in: strip the whitespace on the right side of the string).

A **token** is a string of characters that is surrounded by whitespace characters on both ends. Tokens are often words, but sometimes they are numbers, symbols, punctuation marks, or some combination.

If we want to read one "word" in the file at a time, we can do the following:

```python
file = open("document.txt", "r")
file_contents = file.read()
word_list = file_contents.split()

for token in word_list:
  print(token)
  
file.close()
```

... This would print the following:

```
testing
testing
1
2
3
```

### Writing Text Files

We can create new files as well as modify ones that already exist.

```python
file = open("document.txt", "w")  # Lets us write to document.txt
file.write("Hello World!")
file.close()
```

This would give us the following for document.txt:

```
Hello World!
```

When we are writing multiple lines to the file, we can put `\n` after each line to indicate that a new line begins.

```python
file = open("document.txt", "w")  # lets us write to document.txt
file.write("Hello\n")
file.write("World!")
file.close()
```

This would give us the following for`document.txt`:

```
Hello
World!
```

If we didn't have the `\n` at the end of `"Hello\n"`, we would get this instead:

```
HelloWorld!
```

**Important: When you write to a file that was opened in write mode, its original contents get deleted!** 

If you want to simply add something to the bottom of an existing file, open it using `"a"` instead of `"w"`.
